## Azure account requirements

**IMPORTANT:** In order to deploy and run this example, you'll need:

- **Azure account**. If you're new to Azure, [get an Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-search/) and you'll get some free Azure credits to get started. See [guide to deploying with the free trial](docs/deploy_lowcost.md).
- **Azure account permissions**:
  - Your Azure account must have `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permissions, such as [Role Based Access Control Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview), [User Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator), or [Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner). If you don't have subscription-level permissions, you must be granted [RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview) for an existing resource group and [deploy to that existing group](docs/deploy_existing.md#resource-group).
  - Your Azure account also needs `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write` permissions on the subscription level.

### Cost estimation

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage.
However, you can try the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.com/e/e3490de2372a4f9b909b0d032560e41b) for the resources below.

- Azure Container Apps: Default host for app deployment as of 10/28/2024. See more details in [the ACA deployment guide](docs/azure_container_apps.md). Consumption plan with 1 CPU core, 2.0 GB RAM. Pricing with Pay-as-You-Go. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-apps/)
- Azure Container Registry: Basic tier. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-registry/)
- Azure App Service: Only provisioned if you deploy to Azure App Service following [the App Service deployment guide](docs/azure_app_service.md).  Basic Tier with 1 CPU core, 1.75 GB RAM. Pricing per hour. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/linux/)
- Azure OpenAI: Standard tier, GPT and Ada models. Pricing per 1K tokens used, and at least 1K tokens are used per question. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/)

- Azure AI Search: Basic tier, 1 replica, free level of semantic search. Pricing per hour. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/)
- Azure Blob Storage: Standard tier with ZRS (Zone-redundant storage). Pricing per storage and read operations. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/)
- Azure Cosmos DB: Serverless tier. Pricing per request unit and storage. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cosmos-db/)
- Azure Monitor: Pay-as-you-go tier. Costs based on data ingested. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/)

To reduce costs, you can switch to free SKUs for various services, but those SKUs have limitations.
See this guide on [deploying with minimal costs](docs/deploy_lowcost.md) for more details.

⚠️ To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use,
either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down`.

## Getting Started

You have a few options for setting up this project.
The easiest way to get started is GitHub Codespaces, since it will setup all the tools for you,
but you can also [set it up locally](#local-environment) if desired.

### GitHub Codespaces

You can run this repo virtually by using GitHub Codespaces, which will open a web-based VS Code in your browser:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=GitHub+Codespaces&message=Open&color=brightgreen&logo=github)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=599293758&machine=standardLinux32gb&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdevcontainer.json&location=WestUs2)

Once the codespace opens (this may take several minutes), open a terminal window.

### VS Code Dev Containers

A related option is VS Code Dev Containers, which will open the project in your local VS Code using the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers):

1. Start Docker Desktop (install it if not already installed)
2. Open the project:
    [![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/azamamirza/nlg-ai-rag)

3. In the VS Code window that opens, once the project files show up (this may take several minutes), open a terminal window.

### Local environment

1. Install the required tools:

    - [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install)
    - [Python 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
      - **Important**: Python and the pip package manager must be in the path in Windows for the setup scripts to work.
      - **Important**: Ensure you can run `python --version` from console. On Ubuntu, you might need to run `sudo apt install python-is-python3` to link `python` to `python3`.
    - [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/download/)
    - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    - [Powershell 7+ (pwsh)](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) - For Windows users only.
      - **Important**: Ensure you can run `pwsh.exe` from a PowerShell terminal. If this fails, you likely need to upgrade PowerShell.

2. Create a new folder and switch to it in the terminal.
3. Run this command to download the project code:

    ```shell
    azd init -t nlg-ai-rag
    ```

    Note that this command will initialize a git repository, so you do not need to clone this repository.

## Deploying

The steps below will provision Azure resources and deploy the application code to Azure Container Apps. To deploy to Azure App Service instead, follow [the app service deployment guide](docs/azure_app_service.md).

1. Login to your Azure account:

    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```

    For GitHub Codespaces users, if the previous command fails, try:

   ```shell
    azd auth login --use-device-code
    ```

1. Create a new azd environment:

    ```shell
    azd env new
    ```

    Enter a name that will be used for the resource group.
    This will create a new folder in the `.azure` folder, and set it as the active environment for any calls to `azd` going forward.
1. (Optional) This is the point where you can customize the deployment by setting environment variables, in order to [use existing resources](docs/deploy_existing.md), [enable optional features (such as auth or vision)](docs/deploy_features.md), or [deploy to free tiers](docs/deploy_lowcost.md).
1. Run `azd up` - This will provision Azure resources and deploy this sample to those resources, including building the search index based on the files found in the `./data` folder.
    - **Important**: Beware that the resources created by this command will incur immediate costs, primarily from the AI Search resource. These resources may accrue costs even if you interrupt the command before it is fully executed. You can run `azd down` or delete the resources manually to avoid unnecessary spending.
    - You will be prompted to select two locations, one for the majority of resources and one for the OpenAI resource, which is currently a short list. That location list is based on the [OpenAI model availability table](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#model-summary-table-and-region-availability) and may become outdated as availability changes.
1. After the application has been successfully deployed you will see a URL printed to the console.  Click that URL to interact with the application in your browser.
It will look like the following:

!['Output from running azd up'](docs/images/endpoint.png)

> NOTE: It may take 5-10 minutes after you see 'SUCCESS' for the application to be fully deployed. If you see a "Python Developer" welcome screen or an error page, then wait a bit and refresh the page.

### Deploying again

If you've only changed the backend/frontend code in the `app` folder, then you don't need to re-provision the Azure resources. You can just run:

```shell
azd deploy
```

If you've changed the infrastructure files (`infra` folder or `azure.yaml`), then you'll need to re-provision the Azure resources. You can do that by running:

```shell
azd up
```

#### Sharing environments

To give someone else access to a completely deployed and existing environment,
either you or they can follow these steps:

1. Install the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
1. Run `azd init -t nlg-ai-rag` or clone this repository.
1. Run `azd env refresh -e {environment name}`
   They will need the azd environment name, subscription ID, and location to run this command. You can find those values in your `.azure/{env name}/.env` file.  This will populate their azd environment's `.env` file with all the settings needed to run the app locally.
1. Set the environment variable `AZURE_PRINCIPAL_ID` either in that `.env` file or in the active shell to their Azure ID, which they can get with `az ad signed-in-user show`.
1. Run `./scripts/roles.ps1` or `.scripts/roles.sh` to assign all of the necessary roles to the user.  If they do not have the necessary permission to create roles in the subscription, then you may need to run this script for them. Once the script runs, they should be able to run the app locally.

## Running locally

You can only run locally **after** having successfully run the `azd up` command. If you haven't yet, follow the [deploying](#deploying) steps above.

1. Run `azd auth login`
2. Change dir to `app`
3. Run `./start.ps1` or `./start.sh` or run the "VS Code Task: Start App" to start the project locally.

See more tips in [the local development guide](docs/localdev.md).

## Using the app

- In Azure: navigate to the Azure WebApp deployed by azd. The URL is printed out when azd completes (as "Endpoint"), or you can find it in the Azure portal.
- Running locally: navigate to 127.0.0.1:50505

Once in the web app:

- Try different topics in chat or Q&A context. For chat, try follow up questions, clarifications, ask to simplify or elaborate on answer, etc.
- Explore citations and sources
- Click on "settings" to try different options, tweak prompts, etc.

## Clean up

To clean up all the resources created by this sample:

1. Run `azd down`
2. When asked if you are sure you want to continue, enter `y`
3. When asked if you want to permanently delete the resources, enter `y`

The resource group and all the resources will be deleted.

## Guidance

Besides the tips below, you can find extensive documentation in the [docs](docs/README.md) folder.

### Customizing the UI and data

Once you successfully deploy the app, you can start customizing it for your needs: changing the text, tweaking the prompts, and replacing the data. Consult the [app customization guide](docs/customization.md) as well as the [data ingestion guide](docs/data_ingestion.md) for more details.

### Monitoring with Application Insights

By default, deployed apps use Application Insights for the tracing of each request, along with the logging of errors.

To see the performance data, go to the Application Insights resource in your resource group, click on the "Investigate -> Performance" blade and navigate to any HTTP request to see the timing data.
To inspect the performance of chat requests, use the "Drill into Samples" button to see end-to-end traces of all the API calls made for any chat request:

![Tracing screenshot](docs/images/transaction-tracing.png)

To see any exceptions and server errors, navigate to the "Investigate -> Failures" blade and use the filtering tools to locate a specific exception. You can see Python stack traces on the right-hand side.

You can also see chart summaries on a dashboard by running the following command:

```shell
azd monitor
```

### Productionizing

This sample is designed to be a starting point for your own production application,
but you should do a thorough review of the security and performance before deploying
to production. Read through our [productionizing guide](docs/productionizing.md) for more details.

### Troubleshooting

Here are the most common failure scenarios and solutions:

1. The subscription (`AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`) doesn't have access to the Azure OpenAI service. Please ensure `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` matches the ID specified in the [OpenAI access request process](https://aka.ms/oai/access).

1. You're attempting to create resources in regions not enabled for Azure OpenAI (e.g. East US 2 instead of East US), or where the model you're trying to use isn't enabled. See [this matrix of model availability](https://aka.ms/oai/models).

1. You've exceeded a quota, most often number of resources per region. See [this article on quotas and limits](https://aka.ms/oai/quotas).

1. You're getting "same resource name not allowed" conflicts. That's likely because you've run the sample multiple times and deleted the resources you've been creating each time, but are forgetting to purge them. Azure keeps resources for 48 hours unless you purge from soft delete. See [this article on purging resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/manage-resources?tabs=azure-portal#purge-a-deleted-resource).

1. You see `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` when the `prepdocs.py` script runs. That's typically due to incorrect SSL certificates setup on your machine. Try the suggestions in this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35569042/ssl-certificate-verify-failed-with-python3/43855394#43855394).

1. After running `azd up` and visiting the website, you see a '404 Not Found' in the browser. Wait 10 minutes and try again, as it might be still starting up. Then try running `azd deploy` and wait again. If you still encounter errors with the deployed app and are deploying to App Service, consult the [guide on debugging App Service deployments](docs/appservice.md). Please file an issue if the logs don't help you resolve the error.
